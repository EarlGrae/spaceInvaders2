Hello!

Im writing this readme because I know for a fact i did this project differently than anyone else,
and would like to explain what is going on. To begin, i want to say that I learned more about pygame, 
and honestly about python as a whole than i ever have before. You might be worndering,
"Why grae, that sounds absolutely delightful! whatever do you mean there is a problem?"
sorry, its really late as im writing this. i dont know why i gave you the voice of an old timey gentleman
but you'd be right, except that i did this project outside of what you would expect. I didnt use the template
provided to us to make my space invaders project

I did begin that way, and I included my modified version of space invaders 1 with this repo. I got the alien
sprites and explosion correctly working, but when i had difficulty with getting the aliens to shoot
i looked for examples elsewhere to see how i could do it. that's when i started getting into higher level
projects, and realised how limited the template we were using to create this project was. what i mean by that was
that it's object oriented, and it's fine to inherit using super() and call it a day, but that still is very limiting

as i learned about overloading the sprite groups and seeing how all the classes can fit together like clockwork,
i started realising that was how i wanted to build my version. less of a group of seperated classes screaming
at each other over inheritance, but a much more cohesive network. something a bit more pythonic. In fact, if you look 
at my version 1, you will see that i attempted some of these methods without really understanding what i was doing, such
as the way i held 3 enemy types. But to learn better methods I started just downloading expert's projects and going 
through line by line, learning their methods and approaches. needless to say, i came out of this several days later 
a lot stronger of a programmer in python.

and I feel like that would have been fine, if i had just left it there. but i found a basic project that I really liked
the structure and logic of. And i said to myself, hey, he did say modify a template space invaders to do all this stuff.
I've got a template here. why not modify that? and that's exactly what i did. i took all the knowlege that I had learned
over those days of pouring through python projects and compacted it into a single space invaders project. And that's what
I also included in this repo

Now, like i said, this is modified by me, but it's not my template. i cant take credit for that. but really, this is why i
personally feel it is ok to do it this way. This project is about learning. from sprites to inheritance, the goal of this
space invaders project is to teach us newbies not only pygame, but moreover python. and i more than demonstrate that I have
fulfilled my goal with this. every single line of my project is heavilly documented, both to serve as a learning ground for
myself as i tinkered, but also to demonstrate beyond just a comment with a copy pasted definition that I know what i'm doing there.
you can point to any line and i can tell you exactly what it does, because even though some of the words arent mine, i poured
over them so many times while learning those methods that they might as well be.

I'm now familliar with using dictionarys as object storage, overloading sprite functions, most pygame methods, and pythonic
syntax not covered in class. so personally, i dont feel like im cheating you by turning in what im doing. rather, i feel like
i solved not only the problem you asked, but another one. in the future, you will see these methods in my work again. and
if you compare this or any future projects to pong, you WILL notice the difference

and at the end of the day, everyone else is also working with a copy pasted template. theirs came from a book they pasted
line by line. mine, on the other hand, demonstrates better use of python, of fucnctions, of pygame, and I know my program
better than anyone else in class or ill eat my proverbial hat. 

Of course, im not expecting you to just agree with me. im perfectly happy with taking an F for this, because even if you
disagree with my reasoning, i learned enough to be happy with my decision. for this reason, I'm also including the work i did
on the origional template before i started my little educational journey. I'm hoping that if you will not accept my final
project, you will instead grade me (albeit poorly) on the work i started doing on that. in that case, this project will be
the dropped one, and we both win.

lastly, i just wanted to say screw pickle. i tried using it and shelve about a thousand different ways, and nothing worked.
well, shelve did, but it was a bug factory producing keys consistantly. i did get it sort of working using the key as the
user's high score, but it did leave my project unstable. i wasnt able to figure out in time what was causing the crashes,
and in my mind a stable project is better than a somewhat unstable one with one additional feature. so i took it out, and
am just going to take the point ding for it. Well, that's it. Thanks for reading my little rant here, and im sorry to take
up so much of your time. have a good night!
